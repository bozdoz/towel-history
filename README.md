# Towel History

*Glad to be on the right side of towel history*

This is the second complete website that I ever created (first was part of chebucto.ns.ca, and is likely irretrievable).  Left in mint*, antiquated condition (all the way back to my 2010 web design class).

* _changed some image links to https_

**It still works!**

## Some Notes

I had no concept of server scripts--how it could simplify web development, what DRY stood for--and I only recently learned of CSS.  Part of the class included Adobe Flash, which I used for more than a few parts of the site.  I used Dreamweaver, which I believed at the time was industry standard (at this moment, I am using Sublime Text, a simple, intuitive text editor).
